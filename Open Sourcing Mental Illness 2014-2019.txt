   This is my first EDA project as a Data Science student in The Brigde Tech School in Madrid. The teacher ask me
to choose a theme I wanted to know more about, to apply the EDA techniques that we learned about in the last 
few weeks.

   I was certain about having my first EDA project about mental illness, and after check various datasets, I decided 
to study evolution in OSMI surveys, comparing years 2014, 2016 and 2019.

   “OSMI its a non-profit corporation dedicated to raising awareness, educating, and providing resources to support 
mental wellness in the tech and open source communities”, in their own words.

   I thought that it was a beautiful and useful information to start my EDA projects path.

   At first I explore 2014 dataset, and after found out that United States had won prices by being the country with 
more tech hirings, I decided to get information of surveyed that work there, as the techworld workers 
representation. In 2019 I couldn’t maintain my decision because the total of surveyed are a much smaller number, 
so I used information of all the nationalities.

   My intention with this project is to get conclusions about companies evolution in mental health responsibilities
and for us, as techworkers (future tech worker in my case), maybe we can achieve information that make realise that
mental health is an important part of self care and we should look for caring systems in companies when we start in 
a new job position.
