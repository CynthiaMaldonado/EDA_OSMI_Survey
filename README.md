# Good to see you!

### For this EDA project I studied evolution in OSMI surveys, comparing years 2014, 2016 and 2019.

### “OSMI it's a non-profit corporation dedicated to raising awareness, educating, and providing resources to support mental wellness in the tech and open source communities”, in their own words.

### At first I explore 2014 dataset, and after found out that United States had won prices by being the country with more tech hirings, I decided to get information of surveyed that work there, as the techworld workers representation. In 2019 I couldn’t maintain my decision because the total of surveyed are a much smaller number, so I used information of all the nationalities.

### My intention with this project is to get conclusions about companies evolution in mental health responsibilities and for us, as techworkers, maybe we can achieve information that make realise that mental health is an important part of self care and we should look for caring systems in companies when we start in a new job position.
